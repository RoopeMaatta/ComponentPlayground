# ComponentPlayground

This site serves as an introduction to who I am, showcasing my work, skills, and CV across full-stack development, architecture, and crafts.

Using custom react components powered by styled-components, this site establishes the Saana Design System foundation.

This is also used as a sandbox for testing and playing around with components.
